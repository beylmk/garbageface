Our application is a motion based game for the android platform. We have four modes of gameplay availible through our menu screen. Each menu button correspondes to a different type of motion caused by screen touches.

The goal of the game is to make the orange ball between the gates on the screen. Each gate can only register a scored point from one direction. Score is kept in the upper left hand corner. Once the player reaches ten points the game switches to boss mode. 

In boss mode our ball turns into a picture of our team member Maddie, and the gates change into doughnuts. In this mode the gates don't respawn, but they also move quickly around the screen and are harder to hit. Upon collecting all the doughnuts the user is returned to the menu screen where they can select a different type of gameplay from our list: Attract, Repulse, Teleport, and Orbital.
